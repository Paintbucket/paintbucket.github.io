Shinguru the Ninja
==================

Shinguru the Ninja is an entry in the Dr Dobb's Challenge 2 competetion, 
of summer 2009.

Shinguru is a very athletic ninja. The best thing he knows is to run. He likes it
so much, that he never wants to stop! So he runs. And runs. And runs some more.
All he needs is someone to guide him on his way, and give him a nudge in the right 
direction from time to time.

The goal of the game is to traverse the hazardous levels, collecting Visual
Studio Tokens on the way. Using only one button, you can jump, climb, wallrun,
swing your sword and slay enemies!

==================
How to play
==================
Since this is a One Button Game, all you really need is the space bar!

TAP SPACE lightly to swing your sword. It can cut through
enemies and even deflect their shurikens!

HOLD AND LET GO OF SPACE to JUMP. Holding space
longer will increase the height of the jump, as
indicated by the blue jump bar over your head.

THE RED BAR represents your current health.

WALLRUN by JUMPING UPWARDS ONTO A WALL.

That's basically it. It can take a little while to get used to, but be 
patient. When you get it, it'll be a breeze! :)
